## And much more...


## Game Description:

	Pokemons have been nothing but slaves to Pokemon Trainers, 
	and they have decided it's enough... 

	Mewtwo has launched Pikachu on a quest to destroy all Trainers, 
	granting him the skill of Thunder once Pikachu has proven 
	himself worthy by completing the quest. With that skill 
	Pikachu will be stronger and will be able to erradicate almost 
	99% of trainers throught his journey. 
	 
	In order for Pikachu to be able to destroy all humans, he must 
	seek for the Creator's blessing. The chances of Pikachu finding  
	the Creator are slim. He must pay close attention to his surroundings 
	after he has proven himself worthy to Mewtwo, because without the blessing 
	he will fail his task upon arriving to the Pokemon League. 

	Beyond the cave lies the Pokemon League. Without the Creator's belssing; 
	all hope is lost...
